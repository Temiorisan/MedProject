      <h3>Healthcare in Nigeria</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>

       The healthcare in Nigeria has meager rates. The country has a mixed form of health care system, in which the public and private sectors of medical care are combined. The main range of qualified medical services is concentrated in private medical institutions. The primary health care in Nigeria is provided by public hospitals. They even have resuscitation units and can be found only in large institutions located in resort areas or large cities.
        Medical personnel is trained in the medical faculties of the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, schools in Zaria and Lagos, and the cities of Kano and Sokoto. In general, there is no shortage of medical establishments in Nigeria — there are even schools for the training of midwives and nurses, a medical faculty, medical schools, two university faculties for laboratory technology, and a dental school. However, it does not entirely provide the country with qualified medical personnel, because the most promising doctors leave Nigeria.
       It should be said that the problem of the quality of service in Nigeria is one of the most acute health challenges in Nigeria. 
       <p>The prices at the private medical institutions are too high for the average citizen, and the services provided there hardly correspond to their cost.</p>
       <li>Сurrent health issues in Nigeria
         There is a very high risk of infectious and parasitic diseases, including
         bacterial diarrhea, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, yellow fever, malaria, 
        and meningitis in Nigeria. Malaria in Nigeria has a particular distribution 
        and is found everywhere. The matter is in the high intensity of its transmission,
         due to which, despite the prevention, more than 15% of newcomers fall ill.
        A hereditary disease called sickle cell anemia is common among the black 
        skinned population. Nigeria has the highest burden of Sickle Cell Disease,
       and according to www.premiumtimesng.com, over 150,000 children die from it
        every year.</li>
        <li>Water is often dirty in Nigeria. The establishments for cleaning water are
         poorly sponsored, and the quality of water is also reduced. This causes 
         diseases. The primary cause of outbreaks of enteric-infectious diseases is
          polluted water since only 57% of the population has permanent access to
           clean drinking water. The lack of clean drinking water is one of the 
        challenges in Nigeria. In October 2005, cholera outbreaks were recorded 
        in the northeastern areas. It resulted in the death of 26 people.</li>

        <li> A special problem of Nigerian health care is AIDS. Nigeria belongs to the
          top ten countries in the world with the most significant number of people 
          infected with AIDS. In 2003, there were 3.6 million HIV-infected and AIDS 
          patients, 310 thousand people died. According to www.avert.org, 3,5 million
           HIV-infected people currently live in Nigeria. One hundred fifty thousand 
           people died from AIDS in Nigeria in 2017, and only about 33% of infected 
           people receive any treatment. From the beginning of the 2000s, actions to
            implement the national program to combat AIDS intensified.

                <p class="carddd">Vaccine hesitancy – the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the
                    availability of vaccines – threatens to reverse progress made in tackling 
                    vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective
                    ways of avoiding disease – it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, 
                    and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved. 
                    Measles, for example, has seen a 30% increase in cases globally. 
                    The reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to
                    vaccine hesitancy. However, some countries that were close to eliminating the
                   disease have seen a resurgence.

                <p class="carddd">Primary health care is usually the first point of contact people have
                    with their health care system, and ideally should provide comprehensive,
                    affordable, community-based care throughout life. 
                    Primary health care can meet the majority of a person’s health needs of
                    the course of their life. Health systems with strong primary health care are needed to achieve universal health coverage. 
                    Yet many countries do not have adequate primary health care facilities. 
                    This neglect may be a lack of resources in low- or middle-income countries,
                     but possibly also a focus in the past few decades on single disease programmes.

       <p> Nigeria as been facing tremendius issues when it
        comes to provision of standard health care to it citizens.</p>
      
        <p>25% of her cizitens dies monthly due accidentthat occurs ranging from heartattack, motovehicle accident, tanker exploition, carborn dioxide e.t.c and 
        the ability to send for help or receive medical attention when needed
        most of the patient dies during long hours of registration Emegencies is nobody's
       portion but when it happeneds there is always the need of the doctor or 
        According to the NBS, the number of lives lost to road traffic accidents 
        from January 2013 to June 2018 are as follows:  2013 – 5,539;  
        2014 – 4,430; 2015 – 5,400; (FRSC):  2016 – 5,053; 2017 – 5,049; 
        January to June, 2018 –  2,623.  Sunday Vanguard’s tally indicated that 
        between July and September 7, 2018, no fewer than 126 lives had also been 
        wasted in road crashes. Summation of these figures gives a heartrending
         total of 28,195 lives crushed in 68 months, an equivalent of 415 lives
      per month, 14 persons per day, and two lives every four hours. 
      This makes Nigeria one of the countries with very high road fatalities in 
      the world. Indeed, in May 2017, the FRSC said that there were 33.7 deaths 
       per 100,000 people in Nigeria every year, making Nigeria one of the countries 
      with the highest number of fatalities in Africa. The FRSC Corps Marshal,
      Boboye Oyeyemi, made the disclosure during the flag-off of the Global Road
     Safety Week at the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Secretariat, Kaduna.
     Zimbabwe has the worst road fatality in the world with 74.5 deaths
      per 100,000 inhabitants.</P> 
    <P>The world average is 17.4; Africa is 26.6; and, 
      according to the International Transport Forum, ITF, Road Safety Annual 
      Report for 2018, the fatality rate for South Africa is 21 while Norway has 
      the least road fatality with two deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. As of March
      2018, the NBS put the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria at 11,653,871.
       With an estimated population of 198 million, the vehicle per population ratio
       is 0.06. Since most crashes involve at least two vehicles, and given that 
       10,026 crashes were recorded in 2017, it means that at least 20,000 of the
        11.654 million registered vehicles were affected in the crashes. </p>
       <P> The figure would be more, if multiple auto crashes were included. Causes 
         of accidents The World Health Organisation, WHO, has listed the causes of
          accidents to include speeding (4-5 per cent); driving under the influence 
          of alcohol and other psychoactive substances; non-use of motorcycle helmets,
           seat-belts, and child restraints; distracted driving; unsafe road infrastructure; 
           unsafe vehicles; inadequate post-crash care; and inadequate law enforcement of 
           raffic laws. Virtually all of the causes are prevalent in Nigeria, especially 
           unsafe road infrastructure. Most of the road networks are in decrepit state and
            can best be described as roads to hell where human lives are wasted daily.</P> 
           <P> The Lagos-Badagry International Highway is one of such roads and this is in
              spite of the ongoing conversion of the road into 10-lane super highway with
               rail line by the Lagos State Government with World Bank funds. Currently, 
               many stretches of the road are death traps accounting for recurring accidents
                daily. Given the humongous lives that are wasted on our roads across the 
                country with the attendant socio-economic losses, all stakeholders must join 
                orces to make Nigerian roads safe. The WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety
                 2017  said that, approximately 1.25 million people die each year on the world’s
                  roads, and between 20 and 50 million sustain non-fatal injuries.</P>
              <P>The Global Status Report on  Road Safety is the first broad assessment of 
                the road safety situation in 178 countries, using data drawn from
                 a standardized survey. The results show that road traffic injuries 
                 remain an important public health problem, particularly for 
                 low-income and middle-income countries like Nigeria.  </P>  
                <p>WHO key facts The newly adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                   Development has set an ambitious target of halving the global 
                   number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2020. 
                   Without sustained action, road traffic crashes are predicted to 
                   become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. Road traffic 
                   crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.</P>  
                  <p> Nearly half of those dying on the world’s roads are “vulnerable
                     road users”: pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. 90% of the 
                     world’s fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income 
                     countries, even though these countries have approximately 54% of 
                     the world’s vehicles. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause 
                     of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years. More than 1.25
                      million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. </P> 
                      <p> How Nigeria lost 28,195 lives to road crashes in 68 months According
                         to the FRSC, there were 12,077 road accidents of which 5,400 persons 
                         died in 2015. In 2016, the NBS said there were 11,363 crashes with 
                         5,053 deaths; and in 2017, 10,026 crashes and 5,049 deaths. Broken 
                         down further, the 5,049 deaths of 2017 occurred as  follows: 
                         First quarter, 1,466; second quarter, 1,207; third quarter, 1,070,
                          and fourth quarter, 1,306 deaths. In the first quarter of 2018, 
                          the NBS said that 1,292 people died in 2,482 road accidents 
                          in Nigeria. Speed violation was reported as the major cause of road
                           crashes in Q1 and it accounted for 50.81 per cent of the total road 
                           crashes reported. Tyre burst and dangerous driving followed closely,
                            accounting for 8.26% and 8.42% respectively of the total road crashes 
                            recorded. The second quarter 2018 road transport data released by the 
                            NBS, penultimate week,    showed that road traffic accidents killed 1,331
                             Nigerians in 2608 crashes.
                              Also, speed violation is reported as the major cause of road crashes in 
                              the second quarter of 2018 and it accounted for 50.65 per cent of the
                               total road crashes reported. Also, tyre burst and dangerous driving 
                               followed closely as they both accounted for 8.59 per cent and 8.40 per cent of 
                               the total road crashes recorded.</p>

                <p class="carddd">Noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease, are collectively responsible for over 70% of all deaths worldwide, or 41 million people. This includes 15 million people dying prematurely, aged between 30 and 69.     
                    Over 85% of these premature deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. 
                    The rise of these diseases has been driven by five major risk factors: 
                    tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets
                    and air pollution. These risk factors also exacerbate mental health issues,
                    that may originate from an early age: half of all mental illness begins by 
                    he age of 14, but most cases go undetected and untreated – suicide is 
                    the second leading cause of death among 15-19 year-olds.
                    Among many things, this year WHO will work with governments to help 
                    them meet the global target of reducing physical inactivity by 15% by

              places where protracted crises (through a combination of challenges 
              such as drought, famine, conflict, and population displacement) and 
              weak health services leave them without access to basic care. 
              Fragile settings exist in almost all regions of the world, and these
               are where half of the key targets in the sustainable development 
               goals, including on child and maternal health, remains unmet.</p>


               <p>Top causes of environment-related deaths
                 Looking across more than 100 disease and injury categories, the report finds that the vast majority of environment-related deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and ischaemic heart disease:
<li>Stroke – 2.5 million deaths annually</li>
<li>Ischaemic heart disease – 2.3 million deaths annually</li>
<li>Unintentional injuries (such as road traffic deaths) – 1.7 million deaths annually</li>
<li>Cancers – 1.7 million deaths annually</li>
<li>Chronic respiratory diseases – 1.4 million deaths annually</li>
<li>Diarrhoeal diseases – 846 000 deaths annually</li>
<li>Respiratory infections – 567 000 deaths annually</li>
<li>Neonatal conditions – 270 000 deaths annually</li>
<li>Malaria – 259 000 deaths annually</li>
<li>Intentional injuries (such as suicides) – 246 000 deaths annually</li>

          <p class="carddd">Every 2 minutes, a child dies of malaria. And each year, more 
            than 200 million new cases of the disease are reported. Although countries 
            have dramatically reduced the total number of malaria cases and deaths since 
            2000, progress in recent years has stalled. Worryingly, in some countries, 
            malaria is on the rise.
             Yes. Many people are bitten by mosquitoes with no side effects except the typical itchy welt. However, mosquitoes can be vectors for many diseases. If a mosquito feeds off a diseased host, some can transmit pathogens 
            that can infect other hosts it subsequently bites. In Nigeria., mosquitoes 
            are known to spread equine encephalitis and dengue fever. Worldwide, they also spread yellow fever, malaria and chikungunya. 
             These illnesses do not have specific treatments.
             Worryingly, in some countries, malaria is on the rise.

Insecticide resistance is more widespread
Of the 80 malaria-affected countries that provided data for the period 2010–2017, resistance to at least 1 of 4 insecticide classes in one malaria vector was detected in 68 countries. Resistance to pyrethroids – the only insecticide class currently used in insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) – is now widespread. However, ITNs continue to be an effective tool for malaria prevention, even in areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids, as evidenced by a large multi-country evaluation  coordinated by WHO.

Malaria is caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that are spread to people through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquito vectors. Of the 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, P. falciparum is the most deadly. The first symptoms of malaria – fever, headache, and chills – usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bit
 Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death.
              People can have varied reactions to each virus and each has been fatal 
              in some cases.</p>
